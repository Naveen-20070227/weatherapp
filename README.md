🌦️ Weather App

This is a simple and responsive weather application built using JavaScript, featuring a clean user interface and real-time weather data fetched from the OpenWeather API. The app allows users to search for any city and instantly view current weather conditions such as temperature, weather status, humidity, and wind speed.

The main goal of this project is to practice API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and frontend fundamentals while keeping the interface minimal and user-friendly. It is suitable for beginners and can be easily extended with additional features.
